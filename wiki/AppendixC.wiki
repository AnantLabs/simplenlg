*Setting up simplenlg in Eclipse:*
If you are using Eclipse to write your Java programs, you would

 #. create a new Project (File>New>Project)
 # add the simplenlg library to the project’s build path by doing the following:
  * go to the Eclipse menu and select Project>Properties>Java Build Path
  * click on the Libraries tab
  * click on the Add External jars button
  * browse to the simplenlg jar file which you downloaded from the web
  * select the simplenlg jar file and click ‘Open’
  * click OK
 # In the project, create a new class which has the main method in it. In this example, let’s call the new class {{{TestMain}}}. 
 # At the top of the class, put in the following import statements:
{{{
    import simplenlg.features.*;
    import simplenlg.realiser.*;
}}}

Following these steps, you should have code that looks like the following:

{{{
        import simplenlg.features.*;
        import simplenlg.realiser.*;

        public class TestMain {

	        /**
        	 * @param args
	         */
        	public static void main(String[] args) {
	        	// TODO Auto-generated method stub

        	}        

        }
}}}
