#summary Specialist lexicon

= Appendix C: Using the NIH Specialist Lexicon  =

Simplenlg comes with a default lexicon which covers the most common words in English.  If this is inadequate, then Simplenlg can be connected to the 300MB [http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Home NIH Specialist lexicon].  The Specialist lexicon contains quite good coverage of general English vocabulary, as well as very detailed coverage of medical terminology.

To use the Specialist lexicon:
  # Download and unpack the latest version of lexAccess from [http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lexAccess/current/web/download.html]. The "lite" version is fine, simplenlg does not need the full version.
  # Add the lexAccess jar file (in the lib directory of the unpacked download) as a library in your application.
  # In your code, create an NIHDBLexicon, specifying the lexical database in the constructor.  The DB is in data\HSqlDb  directory of the unpacked download. For example
{{{
	static String DB_FILENAME = "C:\\NIHDB\\lexAccess2011\\data\\HSqlDb\\lexAccess2011.data";
	Lexicon lexicon = new NIHDBLexicon(DB_FILENAME);
}}}	


*Notes:*

You must use the lexAccess version of the lexicon.  Do *not* use
main version in [http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lexicon/current/web/release].
This will not work!

If you use an old version of the lexicon, you may also need the lexCheck jar file.  This can be obtained from
[http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lexCheck/current/web/download.html]

The [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/copyright.html copyright conditions] of the Specialist lexicon state that it is in the public domain, but ask that its use be acknowledged.
