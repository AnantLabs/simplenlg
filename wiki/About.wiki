= Introduction =

SimpleNLG is a simple Java API designed to facilitate the generation of Natural Language. It is intended as the "realisation engine" for Natural Language Generation architectures, and has been used successfully in a number of projects, including [http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/babytalk/ the BabyTalk Project]. 

For details of its design and examples of its use, please refer to the following publication:

= Version history and hosting =
SimpleNLG has now been moved to a public repository due to increased demand for access to the source code. Its old homepage can be found on [http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/simplenlg/ here].

The present version of simpleNLG is v4.0. This is the version hosted on this site. In this version, the API has undergone significant modifications. The previous stable release was simplenlg v3. This version is still available from the old homepage, but is no longer being maintained.

= Summary of features =
SimpleNLG handles the following:

* Lexicon/morphology system: The default lexicon computes inflected forms (morphological realisation). We believe this has quite good coverage. Morphology in simplenlg v3 was partially based on the rules in the Sussex morphg system. Morphology in simplenlg V4 can is based on a modified version of the NIH Specialist Lexicon.

* Realiser: Generates texts from a syntactic form. Grammatical coverage is very limited compared to tools such as KPML and FUF/SURGE, but we believe it is adequate for many NLG tasks.

* Microplanning: Currently just simple aggregation, hopefully will grow over time.
