#summary Adding adjectives via ‘modifier’

= Adding adjectives via ‘modifier’ =

We know for a fact that Mary is an good runner, so we’d like to assign Mary a suitable adjective, like ‘fast’.  This can be generated by the simplenlg library using the concept of *modifier*.

To deem Mary ‘fast’, however, you will no longer want to refer to her simply as the ‘subject’ of the sentence. Instead, let’s also define her name as a noun phrase (which it is). In that way, we can ascribe the adjective ‘fast’ to Mary (which she certainly is) by means of the *modifier* function.
{{{
	NPPhraseSpec subject = nlgFactory.createNounPhrase("Mary");
	NPPhraseSpec object = nlgFactory.createNounPhrase("the monkey");1
	VPPhraseSpec verb = nlgFactory.createVerbPhrase("chase");
}}}
Now, we can apply the adjective ‘fast’ to Mary by writing:
{{{
	subject.addModifier("fast");
}}}
With the initial code in place (assuming that a Realiser {{{realiser}}} has been created already):
{{{
	p.setSubject(subject);
	p.setObject(object);
	p.setVerb(verb);

	String output3 = realiser.realiseSentence(p);
	System.out.println(output3);
}}}
The output will be:
 {{{Fast Mary chases the monkey.}}}

Similarly, we can let the world know that Mary, true to her nature, is chasing the monkey quickly.  The adverb ‘quickly’ may also be added using the addModifier function, but this time it's the verb that's being modified:
{{{
	verb.addModifier("quickly"); 
}}}
The output will be:
 {{{Fast Mary quickly chases the monkey.}}}

{{{[1]}}} Note that we can also construct the noun phrase "the monkey" in the following way:
{{{ 
	NPPhraseSpec object = nlgFactory.createNounPhrase("monkey");
	object.setDeterminer("the");
}}}
