#summary What are complements?

= What are complements? =

As far as simplenlg is concerned, a complement is anything that comes after the verb.  When you label something as a complement and hand it to simplenlg to be realized, simplenlg will place it, no matter what it is, after the verb.{{{[1]}}}  If you've specified an object, it will place it after both the verb and the object.

Examples of complements are underlined in the sentences below:

 # Mary is happy.
 # Mary wrote the letter quickly.
 # Mary just realized that her holidays are over.

The underlined words and phrases in the examples above are all different parts of speech. In example #1, it's an adjective phrase; in example #2, it's an adverb; and it’s a ‘that-clause’ (complementiser phrase) in example #3. But from simplenlg’s point of view, the underlined bits all have one thing in common:  they are complements and appear after the verb. Although it has an understanding of subjects, verbs, and objects, simplenlg has a very limited concept of adjective phrases that follow verbs, adverbial phrases, that-clauses, or other parts of speech that can appear after a verb. But it does understand the concept of a complement, and because of this, phrases that appear after a verb can be generated using the simplenlg library.  As can be seen in Table 2, complements encompass a variety of phrase types.  (For a full listing of Parts of Speech simplenlg can handle, see [Section3 Table 1].)

Note that only things of type {{{SPhraseSpec}}} can take a complement; nouns and verbs can take a modifier, which we discuss next.

{{{[1]}}} Even if you label a nonsense string like "shabadoo" as a complement, simplenlg will happily add it after the verb.
