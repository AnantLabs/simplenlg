#summary Adding multiple subjects, objects and complements

= Adding multiple subjects, objects and complements =
An {{{SPhraseSpec}}} can have multiple subjects, objects and complements but not multiple verbs (although a future version of simplenlg might include this functionality). This is done with the {{{CoordinatedPhraseElement}}} class. Let’s say you have a monkey that wants to chase poor George. To place your monkey in the fray, you would write:

{{{
	NPPhraseSpec subject1 = nlgFactory.createNounPhrase("Mary");
	NPPhraseSpec subject2 = nlgFactory.createNounPhrase("your", "monkey");
	CoordinatedPhraseElement subj = nlgFactory.createCoordinatedPhrase(subject1, subject2);
	p.setSubject(subj);
	p.setVerb("chase");
	p.setObject("George");
}}}

The resulting output is:
 {{{Mary and your monkey chase George.}}}

simplenlg has automatically added the conjunction ‘and’ and has changed the ending of the verb so that it agrees with the multiple subjects of the sentence.

Similarly, you can have multiple objects and complements in an {{{SPhraseSpec}}}. Let’s suppose Mary and the monkey have found more people to terrorize in what’s turning out to be a growing parade of horror.  Instead of {{{p.setObject(“George”)}}}, you would write: 

{{{
	NPPhraseSpec object1 = nlgFactory.createNounPhrase("George");
	NPPhraseSpec object2 = nlgFactory.createNounPhrase("Joey");
	CoordinatedPhraseElement obj = nlgFactory.createCoordinatedPhrase(object1, object2);
	obj.addCoordinate("Martha");
	p.setObject(obj);
}}}

The resulting output will be:
 {{{Mary and your monkey chase George, Joey and Martha.}}}

If Mary and her devious monkey run by so quickly that you can't see _who_ they're chasing, you can change the conjunction on the coordinated elements:
{{{
	obj.setFeature(Feature.CONJUNCTION, "or");
}}}

The resulting output will be:
 {{{Mary and your monkey chase George, Joey or Martha.}}}

The {{{createCoordinatedPhrase}}} method can take all kinds of arguments – {{{NPPhraseSpec}}}, {{{PPPhraseSpec}}}, or even simple {{{string}}}s.
